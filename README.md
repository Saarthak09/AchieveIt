# Achieve It
## Strive towards more, together!


The main idea behind Achieve It! was that we noticed that a lot of people have been unmotivated to workout during COVID, with that in mind we started thinking about what drives us as people to achieve our goals and although the list is very large and unique to each personâ€™s personal goals, working and collaborating with friends and colleagues does drive us to do more. Whether your competitiveness drives you to perform better than your peers or the sense of community is what drives you, we can all agree that being in a group improves our will to achieve, especially when working towards one goal.
